    ("1. The architect should be equipped with knowledge of many branches of "
        "study and varied kinds of learning, for it is by his judgement that all "
        "work done by the other arts is put to test. This knowledge is the child "
        "of practice and theory. Practice is the continuous and regular exercise "
        "of employment where manual work is done with any necessary material "
        "according to the design of a drawing. Theory, on the other hand, is the "
        "ability to demonstrate and explain the productions of dexterity on the "
        "principles of proportion."), "",
    ("2. It follows, therefore, that architects who have aimed at acquiring "
        "manual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a "
        "position of authority to correspond to their pains, while those who "
        "relied only upon theories and scholarship were obviously hunting the "
        "shadow, not the substance. But those who have a thorough knowledge of "
        "both, like men armed at all points, have the sooner attained their "
        "object and carried authority with them."), "",
    ("3. In all matters, but particularly in architecture, there are these two "
        u"points:\u2014the thing signified, and that which gives it its significance. "
        "That which is signified is the subject of which we may be speaking; and "
        "that which gives significance is a demonstration on scientific "
        "principles. It appears, then, that one who professes himself an "
        "architect should be well versed in both directions. He ought, therefore, "
        "to be both naturally gifted and amenable to instruction. Neither natural "
        "ability without instruction nor instruction without natural ability can "
        "make the perfect artist. Let him be educated, skilful with the pencil, "
        "instructed in geometry, know much history, have followed the "
        "philosophers with attention, understand music, have some knowledge of "
        "medicine, know the opinions of the jurists, and be acquainted with "
        "astronomy and the theory of the heavens."))
